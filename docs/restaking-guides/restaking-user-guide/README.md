# Restaking User Guide

**Introduction**

Restaking is a new primitive in crypto-economic security. These guides will walk you through how LST holders and Native Stakers can restake, withdraw and earn points on the platform.

**Liquid vs Native Restaking**

Liquid restaking is the process of depositing liquid staking tokens (LSTs), e.g. stETH or rETH, into the EigenLayer smart contracts.

Native restaking describes the process of changing an Ethereum validator's `withdrawCredential`to EigenLayer's smart contracts.

**Withdrawal Delay**

EigenLayer is launching with a maximally conservative withdrawal delay, which is intended to only decrease over time.&#x20;

A 7-day delay window should give ample time to review withdrawals for anything suspicious and pause relevant functionality if needed.
