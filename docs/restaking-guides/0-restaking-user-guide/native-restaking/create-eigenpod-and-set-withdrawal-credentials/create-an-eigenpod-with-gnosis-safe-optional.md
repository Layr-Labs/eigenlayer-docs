# Create an EigenPod with Gnosis Safe (Optional)

Creating an EigenPod using Gnosis Safe is an important feature requested by a large number of community members. We are actively working to improve this user experience but based on current design:

Step 1: Open Etherscan for your current network (Testnet or Mainnet).

Step 2: Find the current EigenPodManager proxy contract address via the [EigenLayer Deployments table here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/master/README.md#deployments).

Step 3: Access the EigenPodManager contract on Etherscan.

Step 4: Open your Gnosis Safe and create a new transaction. Copy the contract ABI, and your wallet address. You can now run the CreatePod function!
