# Partial Withdrawals

:::info
Due to how withdrawals from Ethereum are designed, users can only initiate one partial withdrawal per[ sequential sweep](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/withdrawals/#validator-sweeping) of all validators (which takes approximately 4-5 days).

All funds unstaked from EigenLayer go through a 7-day escrow period before being able to be withdrawn. Thus after you initiate your unstake, you must wait 7-days before being able to withdraw your assets.
:::

**Step 1:** Unstake

Click **Unstake** to initiate the escrow period.
