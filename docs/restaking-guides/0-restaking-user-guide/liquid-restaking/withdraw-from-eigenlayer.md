# Withdraw from EigenLayer

{% hint style="info" %}
All funds unstaked from EigenLayer go through a 7-day escrow period before being able to be withdrawn. Thus after you initiate (queue) the withdrawal, you must wait 7-days before being able to withdraw your assets.
{% endhint %}



**Step 1:** Navigate to the **Unstake tab**, enter your withdrawal amount, and click **Next:**

Click **Confirm** when prompted by your wallet:

Once the transaction confirms, you should see your Restaked balance move to **Unstake pending.** Your withdrawal is now in escrow:
