# Restake LSTs



## Restake with Liquid Staking Tokens

**Step 1:** Open the EigenLayer App and connect your Web3 wallet, making sure you are connected to the Ethereum Mainnet network. Visit EigenLayer on the Ethereum Mainnet at [**app.eigenlayer.xyz**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/)**.**

**Step 2:** Select the token you want to restake.

**Step 3:** Token Approval and Deposit. Enter the amount you would like to restake and click **Deposit**.

If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to approve token spending before you can restake. [Token Approval](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683-What-is-a-token-approval-) gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet. Set a spending cap, and click **Next**.

**Step 4:** Once the approval transaction is confirmed, you will be prompted to **Confirm** the deposit.

**Step 5:** **Approve** the Deposit transaction via your wallet.

If successful, you will see the corresponding increase in your Restaked balance in the app:
