## Restake with Liquid Staking Tokens

**Step 1:** Open the EigenLayer App and connect your Web3 wallet, making sure you are connected to the Ethereum Mainnet network. Visit EigenLayer on the Ethereum Mainnet at [**app.eigenlayer.xyz**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/)**.**

**Step 2:** Select a Token

Select the token you want to stake

**Step 3:** Token **Approval** and **Deposit**

Enter the amount you would like to deposit and click **Next:**

If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to approve token spending first.

[_Token approval_](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683-What-is-a-token-approval-) _gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet._

Set a spending cap, and click **Next:**

Click **Approve:**

Once the approval transaction confirms, you will be prompted to **confirm** the deposit:

If successful, you will receive a confirmation message:

**Step 4:** Monitor your Staking Rewards & Restaked Ratio on the [homepage](http://goerli.eigenlayer.xyz/). Restakers will earn Restaked Points based on their total EigenLayer restaking contribution. Restaked Points are calculated based on the amount staked over time, in units of ETH per second. Your Restaked Ratio is your restaked points over the total restaked points of all restakers.
