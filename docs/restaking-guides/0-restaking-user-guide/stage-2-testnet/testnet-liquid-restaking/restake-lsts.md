Step 2: Select the token you want to restake.

Step 3: Token Approval and Deposit. Enter the amount you would like to restake and click Deposit.

If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to approve token spending before you can restake. [Token Approval](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683-What-is-a-token-approval-) gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet. Set a spending cap, and click Next.

Once the approval transaction is confirmed, you will be prompted to confirm the deposit. Approve the Deposit transaction via your wallet.

If successful, you will see the corresponding increase in your Restaked balance in the app:
