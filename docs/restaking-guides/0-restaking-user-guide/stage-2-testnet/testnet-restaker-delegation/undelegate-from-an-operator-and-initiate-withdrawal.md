# Undelegate from an Operator and Initiate Withdrawal

Restakers can Undelegate their balance from an Operator at any time. Undelegation flows are the same for both Native and LST Restakers.

:::warning
Initiating an Undelegate transaction will also automatically queue a withdrawal (Unstake) of your funds. The Undelegate and Queue Withdrawal transactions are combined due to the security architecture of EigenLayer smart contracts.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the Operator tab, click the tile for the Operator you have delegated your funds to. Click the Undelegate button to continue.
