## What is an Actively Validated Service (AVS)?

An AVS is a service built on EigenLayer that requires its own distributed validation semantics for verification. Please see the [Intro to EigenLayer](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/overview/) for background context on the broader EigenLayer ecosystem.

Each AVS has its own set of contracts that hold state relevant to the service’s functionality, such as what operators are running the service and how much stake is securing the service. Examples of these services may include sidechains, data availability layers, new virtual machines, keeper networks, oracle networks, bridges, threshold cryptography schemes, and trusted execution environments (TEEs).

## Why Build an AVS?

Launching new Web3 projects requires substantial time and effort to bootstrap capital and operators. Builders should focus on their key product differentiators, rather than bootstrapping economic security. Building an Actively Validated Service (AVS) on EigenLayer offers enhanced security, decentralization, and cost efficiency by leveraging Ethereum’s staking mechanism through restaking. 

The key benefits of building an AVS on EigenLayer include:
- Security via Restaking: Leverage Ethereum’s staking mechanism to secure your service.
- Focus on your project's unique value: Spend less time and resources accumulating economic security from scratch.
- Bootstrap Operator network: Quickly access a large network of experienced Operators.
- Decentralization and Trust: Build on a trust-minimized, decentralized infrastructure.
- Composability: Seamlessly integrate with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
