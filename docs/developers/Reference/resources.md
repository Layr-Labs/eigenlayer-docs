We are in the process of updating our samples, SDKs, and the EigenLayer CLI to include Rewards and Slashing capabilities. The samples, SDKs, and CLI will be
updated as soon as possible. Use the samples now to get familiar with EigenLayer.
For more information on Rewards and Slashing, refer to the [Rewards](https://github.com/eigenfoundation/ELIPs/blob/main/ELIPs/ELIP-001.md) and [Slashing](https://github.com/eigenfoundation/ELIPs/blob/main/ELIPs/ELIP-002.md) ELIPs,
