title: Rewards Overview
---

Rewards enable AVSs to make rewards to Stakers and Operators. AVSs have the flexibility to set custom logic for rewards 
to individual Operators. Examples of custom logic for rewards include:
* Work completed.
* More equal distribution of Operator support for decentralization or security reasons.

For more information, see:
