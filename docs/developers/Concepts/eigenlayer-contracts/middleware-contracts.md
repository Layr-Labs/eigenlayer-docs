title: EigenLayer Middleware Contracts
---

The EigenLayer middleware contracts are higher level interfaces to the [EigenLayer core contracts](core-contracts.md).
The middleware contracts can be: 
* Deployed as is. The exception is the ServiceManager contract used to register and deregister an AVS with EigenLayer.
* Modified to implement logic specific to the AVS before deploying 
* Not used. In this case, the interfaces present in the middleware contracts must be implemented in the AVS contracts.

New AVS developers can use the middleware contracts as the higher level interface to the core contracts.

The middleware contracts are documented in the [eigenlayer-middleware](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware) repository.
The ServiceManagerBase contract is the reference implementation for the onchain registration and deregistration that each AVS must have.
