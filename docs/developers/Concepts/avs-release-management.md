title: AVS Release Management
---

The Release Management Service (RMS) enables verifiable container image signing using Ethereum keys and supports 
OpenContainerInterface (OCI) compliant signature publishing to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). The RMS is an optional 
service that enables:

* AVS developers to tag and sign releases.
* Operators to view the latest releases they are registered to run.
* Operators to verify the signature of the release container.

For information on:
* Signing and publishing AVS releases, refer to [Release AVS](../HowTo/publish/release-avs.md).
* Get and verify releases, refer to [Get and Verify AVS Releases](../../operators/howto/get-and-verify-releases.md).
