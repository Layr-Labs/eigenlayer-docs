## EigenDA Contracts

EigenDA's contracts are based heavily on the EigenLayer middleware contracts, located in this repo: [`Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware`](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/).

### Deployment Addresses

An up-to-date reference of our current contract deployments can be found in the middleware repository README: [`eigenlayer-middleware/README.md#deployments`](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/?tab=readme-ov-file#deployments).

### Technical Documentation

Our most up-to-date contract-level documentation can be found in the middleware repository's docs folder: [`eigenlayer-middleware/docs`](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/tree/dev/docs).
