# Blob Explorer

The purpose of the blob explorer is to show blob realtime metadata and summary
statistics for debugging and monitoring purposes.

The Blob Explorer renders:

* Throughput data for the last hour
* A view of blob metadata for any given blob key

For links to network blob explorers please consult a specific network page, [see index](./networks/README.md).
