# Blob Explorer

The purpose of the [Blob Explorer](https://blobs-goerli.eigenda.xyz/) is to show
blob metadata and summary statistics for debugging and monitoring purposes.

<!-- TODO: Check whether we can see actual blobs on the blob explorer now -->

The Blob Explorer makes available:

* Throughput data for the last hour
* The contents of the last 100 blobs published
* A view of blob metadata for any given blob key
