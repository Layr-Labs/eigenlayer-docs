# Optimistic Rollup Integration Strategies

There are a few viable design strategies for securely an optimistic rollup with EigenDA. This document aims to describe them in detail to provide rollup engineers with a strong understanding of how an EigenDA integration would impact their tech stack and security model.

For any given rollup there are four main concerns inherent to an integration with external DA:

1. **Dispersal.** The rollup batcher must write transaction batches to the DA layer, wait for confirmation, and write the resulting DA certificate to the rollup inbox.
2. **Certificate Verification.** Either the rollup inbox contract or the rollup OS must verify that DA certificate is valid, i.e. that enough operators have certified the blob available, before reading the DA cert's data from the DA layer. This ensures that a transaction batch referenced by an invalid certificate is not executed.
3. **Retrieval.** Rollup full nodes must retrieve EigenDA blobs as part of the L2 derivation/challenge process. Otherwise they cannot keep up with the state of the L2.
4. **Data Verification.** The rollup's fraud arbitration protocol must be capable of verifying that the EigenDA blob data used to generate a state root matches the KZG commitment provided in the EigenDA cert posted to the rollup inbox. In doing this verification, the chain ensures that the transaction data used to generate the rollup's state root was not manipulated by the sequencer/proposer.

Each strategy used to integrate EigenDA can be defined by how these for concerns are handled.

## Trusted Verification Strategy (M0) {#M0}

The trusted verification strategy does not do certificate or data verification. Instead it focuses on dispersal and retrieval for the sake of simplicity, but at the cost of security. This is an integration model fit for testnet. Let's walk through the lifecycle of an L2 batch:

1. A user authors a transaction using their wallet, and sends this transaction to the rollup sequencer.
2. The batcher component of the rollup sequencer prepares an L2 batch which includes the user's transaction, which it sends to the EigenDA disperser, receiving an EigenDA certificate in return. The EigenDA certificate contains everything needed to retrieve the blob from the EigenDA operator set.
    1. A lot is happening behind the scenes in the EigenDA disperser. First the disperser is encoding the blob and sending encoded chunks to the EigenDA operator set.
    2. Then the disperser collects signatures of dispersal from the EigenDA operator set, and aggregates them into a single BLS signature.
    3. Next disperser sends a transaction to the EigenDA Manager contract on Ethereum with the aggregated signature and other blob metadata.
    4. The EigenDA Manager contract on Ethereum is responsible for verifying EigenDA certificates, and if they verify, recording that verification in storage. Verification consists of ensuring the the aggregated signature is valid and is based on the current EigenDA operator set. This blob verification status is important later on.
    5. Finally, the EigenDA disperser returns the blob certificate to the caller.
3. The batcher then sends a transaction to the rollup inbox contract on Ethereum with the EigenDA blob certificate as calldata, which accepts the EigenDA blob cert.

On the derivation side, there is a similar flow in reverse. When an L2 full node encounters an EigenDA certificate in the rollup inbox, it knows to retrieve the underlying blob from the EigenDA operator set using the EigenDA client, and then interpret the transactions inside.

Please keep in mind that this integration model is *insecure*. The rollup sequencer is completely trusted in this scenario, because the fraud proof system is disabled, and state roots cannot be challenged. This means the sequencer can post whatever state roots they want to the bridge contract and potentially steal funds.

## L2 Inbox Certificate Verification Strategy (M1) {#M1}

The natural locations for dispersal, retrieval, and data verification logic are unambiguous â€“ dispersal logic can only live inside the rollup batcher, retrieval logic can only live inside the derivation pipeline, and data verification logic can only live inside the fraud proof system. That leaves certificate verification logic, which could be placed either in the rollup's inbox contract or inside the rollup virtual machine executing off-chain. The question of where to place this logic boils is the key distinguishing factor between the "M1" and "M2" integration paths.

An instructive way to dive into the L2 inbox certificate verification strategy is to follow an L2 transaction from origination to finalization on Ethereum. We can further break this down into two stages, L2 chain finalization and L2 bridge finalization.

### L2 Chain Finalization

First, L2 chain finalization. An L2 transaction is finalized with respect to the L2 chain when the transaction has been sequenced in the L2 inbox contract. When this process is complete, any L2 node can say with confidence that the transaction is part of the cannonical L2 chain and is not subject to a reorg.

For example, if you were selling your car and a buyer paid you by sending you a USDC on a secure rollup, it would be important to wait until the transaction had reached L2 chain finalization before letting them drive away with your vehicle.

Let's walk through how EigenDA affects this process:

1. A user authors a transaction using their wallet, and sends this transaction to the rollup sequencer.
2. The batcher component of the rollup sequencer prepares an L2 batch which includes the user's transaction, which it sends to the EigenDA disperser, receiving an EigenDA certificate in return. The EigenDA certificate contains everything needed to retrieve the blob from the EigenDA operator set.
    1. A lot is happening behind the scenes in the EigenDA disperser. First the disperser is encoding the blob and sending encoded chunks to the EigenDA operator set.
    2. Then the disperser collects signatures of dispersal from the EigenDA operator set, and aggregates them into a single BLS signature.
    3. Next disperser sends a transaction to the EigenDA Manager contract on Ethereum with the aggregated signature and other blob metadata.
    4. The EigenDA Manager contract on Ethereum is responsible for verifying EigenDA certificates, and if they verify, recording that verification in storage. Verification consists of ensuring the the aggregated signature is valid and is based on the current EigenDA operator set. This blob verification status is important later on.
    5. Finally, the EigenDA disperser returns the blob certificate to the caller.
3. The batcher then sends a transaction to the rollup inbox contract on Ethereum with the EigenDA blob certificate as calldata.
4. The rollup inbox contract is smart, and it is programmed not to "accept" the EigenDA certificate unless the certificate is valid. To avoid repeating work, the rollup inbox contract can make a `verifyBlob()` call on the EigenDA contract, passing in the EigenDA certificate.
5. Inside the `verifyBlob()` implementation, the EigenDA manager contract checks against its storage whether the blob certificate was verified.
6. Back inside the inbox rollup contract, the EigenDA blob certificate is registered in the inbox if the `verifyBlob()` returned `true`. Otherwise the inbox returns an error.

At this point the the user's transaction has been confirmed on the rollup. Once the weak subjectivity window passes (~13 minutes), the user's transaction can be considered finalized.

### L2 Bridge Finalization

L2 bridge finalization is necessary for bridging assets or data from the L2 to the L1. Bridge finalization depends on the rollup bridge contract on the L1 arriving on an accurate L2 state root. This is where fraud or validity proofs come in.

Every L2 full node is responsible for deriving the L2's state root from the L1. In the absence of fraud, this is a relatively simple process with EigenDA:

1. If an L2 full node reads an EigenDA cert from the rollup inbox, it knows  this DA cert is valid because otherwise it would have been rejected from the inbox. So it uses the EigenDA client to retrieve the EigenDA blob using the EigenDA cert.
2. The full node executes the L2 block as described in the L2 blob against the current L2 state.
3. If the full node is a proposer/validator, it will post the state root of the L2 state to the rollup bridge contract on Ethereum every few blocks.
4. If no fraud proof has been submitted within the challenge window (~7 days), then the state root in the rollup bridge contract is considered valid and any outbound assets or messages are released by the bridge contract.

In the event of a fraud challenge, the process is more complex. There is a second, equivalent state transition function for generating state roots which is much slower but also much more rigorous fraud prove.

That process models the L2 state as virtual machine, complete with an operating system, which continuously reads messages from the rollup inbox contract using a special `ReadInboxMessage` opcode, and handles them accordingly. If an inbox message describes a batch of raw L2 transactions, the L2 OS knows it should execute them. If an inbox message describes an EigenDA cert, the L2 operating system knows that it should pass the KZG commitment inside the cert to the special `ReadPreImage` opcode to read the underlying data, and then handle the messages returned.

This VM state transition function process is useful because it makes it possible to rigorously prove that the state root was generated based on the exact data referenced by the EigenDA cert.

Let's walk through a scenario where the proposer is dishonest, in order to illustrate:

1. The proposer encounters an EigenDA cert and rather than reading data from EigenDA honestly, decides to read data from elsewhere, not committed to by the KZG commitment in the EigenDA cert. The proposer generates a state root on the basis of executing these messages, and posts this state root to the rollup bridge contract.
2. A challenger sees that their state root for a given L2 block does not match the one posted by the proposer in the bridge contract, and makes a contract call to begin a challenge.
3. The challenger and the defender alternate narrowing the scope of their disagreement to a specific opcode of the VM state transition function, until they've narrowed their disagreement to a specific opcode. In this case, the challenge opts to challenge the `ReadPreImage` opcode, since this is where the correct EigenDA should have been read.
4. The challenger invokes the arbitration contract with the necessary VM state to execute the `ReadPreImage` opcode, as well as necessary extra data for proving that the opcode was executed correctly. This extra data includes the chunk of data that should have been read (only 32 bytes of data are read at a time) as well as a KZG proof showing that the data matches the KZG commitment that the opcode was invoked with. The arbitration contract checks whether the data matches the KZG commitment and proof. If it does, the challenge fails. Otherwise, the challenge is successful and the state root is discarded as invalid.

In order to implement an EigenDA integration with fraud proofs, the underlying rollup must support passing KZG commitments to `ReadPreImage` opcode. The rest of the L2 VM design works as-is for arbitrating fraud.

## L2 OS Certificate Verification Strategy (M2) {#M2}

The V2 integration strategy is similar to the V1 integration strategy, with the differece that EigenDA certificates are not verified on Ethereum. Instead, they are verified within the L2 itself, such that the validity of DA certs is enforced by the same fraud proof mechanism that is used with all other L2 state. In this mode, a rollup batcher may submit invalid EigenDA certs to the rollup inbox, such that L2 nodes interpret these invalid DA certs and discard them. If a rollup proposer submits a state root based on data referenced by an EigenDA cert, it is possible to successfully challenge that state root.

This integration strategy depends on the ability of the L2 OS to validate EigenDA certs, which requires an authenticated view into the current EigenDA operator set. Specifically, the L2 OS must have access to L1 state roots, so that Eigenlayer contract storage proofs may be verified.

## Analysis

Although the rollup inbox implementation is simpler, the L2 OS implementation is more desirable since it avoids adding validity constraints to batch updates, which would incur significant signature verification gas costs regardless of whether the sequencer is honest. When placed within the rollup OS, DA certificate verification only incurs on-chain costs when the sequencer is dishonest.
