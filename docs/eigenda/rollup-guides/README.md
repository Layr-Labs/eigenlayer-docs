# Rollup Guides

This section contains specs, guides and examples for integrating rollups with EigenDA.

<!-- Data Availability is a requirement for both for ZK and Optimistic rollups
([source][ref1]):

* In both optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups, if transaction data is not
available, then participants in the rollup will be unable to reconstruct the
rollup state so as to bridge out their assets if desired.
* In optimistic rollups, if transaction data is not available, challengers are
* unable to check
the sequencer’s state commitment and create fraud proofs when applicable. -->
