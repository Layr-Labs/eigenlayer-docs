# Delegation Requirements

:::info
Active Operator Set Cap: the active operator set cap is currently
limited to 200 operators for both Mainnet and Holesky. We will review this operator cap on an ongoing basis,
and explicitly communicate future changes.
:::

EigenDA currently only allows a limited number of operators to join the protocol. This restriction relates directly to the cost of bridging EigenDA availability attestations to the Ethereum L1 and will be relaxed as this cost is alleviated via various technological improvements.

The EigenDA operator cap means that in order to be an operator for EigenDA, you must first register as an EigenLayer operator and meet certain stake requirements. These requirements are evaluated on a per-quorum basis, relative to the weighting for each quorum:


<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">

    - Minimum stake floor: Each operator must have
      - at least 32 ETH to join the ETH quorum, or
      - at least 1 EIGEN to join the EIGEN quorum.
    - Congested operator set stake floor: When the global operator cap (200) is reached for the quorum, the joining operator must have more than 1.1X the quorum weight of the current lowest-weighted operator in order to replace that operator.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="holesky" label="Holesky">

    - Minimum stake floor: Each operator must have at least 32 ETH.
    - Congested operator set stake floor: When the global operator cap (200) is reached for the quorum, the joining operator must have more than 1.1X the quorum weight of the current lowest-weighted operator in order to replace that operator.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Details about how these requirements are enforced and the process by which DA nodes join a quorum for which they are eligible can be found at the [Registration Protocol Overview](../registration-protocol.md).


## Checking eligibility

In order to determine the current TVL of the top 200 operators for each quorum, please visit our
AVS page ([Mainnet](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/eigenda), [Holesky](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/eigenda)) and sort by `TVL
Ascending.` Observe the first 200 operators listed for the quorum and the amount of ETH TVL
delegated to them. Please keep in mind that the AVS Page reflects the
operator stake on EigenLayer, which is used to update the EigenDA operator set
stake weights on a weekly basis (Wednesdays at 17:00 UTC), so the EigenDA stake
may lag the real-time EigenLayer stake by at most 7 days.


## Have I been churned?

Operators that have been ejected can verify the change in two ways:

1. Visit the EigenDA AVS application to observe whether your Operator is present
in the active operator set on the [AVS page](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/eigenda).
2. Observe your EigenDA Operator log for the following logs. If you see this
consistently, then your operator is not receiving any disperser traffic and you
may have been ejected.  This is not an error but if you only see this log line
repeatedly then it means you may not be receiving any disperser traffic.
