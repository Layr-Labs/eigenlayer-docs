# Metrics and Monitoring

These instructions provide a quickstart guide to run the Prometheus, Grafana,
and Node exporter stack.

**Step 1:** Move your current working directory to the monitoring folder:

```
cd monitoring
cp .env.example .env
```

- Open the `.env` file, ensure the location of `prometheus.yml` is correct for your environment.
- In the `prometheus.yml` file:
  - Update prometheus config [file](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-operator-setup/blob/master/monitoring/prometheus.yml)
    is updated with the metrics port (`NODE_METRICS_PORT`) of the eigenda node in parent folder `.env` file
  - Ensure the eigenda container name for `scrape_configs.targets` matches the value of the parent folder `.env` file (`MAIN_SERVICE_NAME`).
  - Make sure the location of prometheus file is correct in [.env](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-operator-setup/blob/master/monitoring/.env.example) file

**Step 2:** Run the following command to start the monitoring stack

```
docker compose up -d
```

**Step 3:** Since eigenda is running in a different docker network we will need
to have prometheus in the same network. To do that, run the following command

```
docker network connect eigenda-network prometheus
```

Note: `eigenda-network` is the name of the network in which eigenda is running.
You can check the network name in eigenda
[.env](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-operator-setup/blob/master/.env.example#L2)
file (`NETWORK_NAME`). This will ensure Prometheus can scrape the metrics from
Eigenda node.

Useful Dashboards: EigenDA offers a set of [Grafana
dashboards](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-operator-setup/tree/master/monitoring/dashboards)
that are automatically imported when initializing the monitoring stack.

If you prefer to set up the metrics and monitoring stack manually, follow the
steps located [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-operator-setup#metrics).
