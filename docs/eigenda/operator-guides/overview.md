# Overview

This guide contains the steps needed to set up your node on the EigenDA testnet.
The testnet is used to test the operational and performance requirements for
running a node before deploying on mainnet. The testnet is under constant stress
tests and has frequent updates to the node software and other network
components. Itâ€™s important to check regularly for new updates to the software
and documentation.

Start by understanding the [Requirements](./requirements/) for being an EigenDA operator and running an EigenDA node. If you are able to satisfy all of the elligibility requirements for becoming a node operator, proceed onward to [run your node](./run-a-node/). It's important that you properly [configure and start your node](./run-a-node/run-with-docker/) before [registering your operator with the network](./run-a-node/registration/) and becoming subject to the SLA. 

EigenDA is in a state of active development. Operators must make sure to listen for [node software updates](./upgrades/software-upgrades/) in the correct channels and to implement these upgrades promptly.
