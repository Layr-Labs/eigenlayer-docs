# Troubleshooting

### Errors while opting in into EigenDA

#### failed to request churn approval
```
Error: failed to opt-in EigenDA Node Network for operator ID: <OPERATOR_ID>, operator address: <OPERATOR_ADDRESS>, error: failed to request churn approval: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to process churn request: registering operator must have 10.000000% more than the stake of the lowest-stake operator. Stake of registering operator: 0, stake of lowest-stake operator: 6301801525718228411481, quorum ID: 0
```
This is because your operator doesn't have enough stake to run EigenDA. Please refer to [this](./README.md#eigenda-churn-approver) to learn more about this error

#### failed to read or decrypt the BLS/ECDSA private key
Please make sure the operator keys [location in the .env file](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda-operator-setup/blob/19c386e38a838e28be27bd2737252d3fe2ce8a62/.env#L83) is correctly populated. Make sure to put correct bls and ecdsa key location
