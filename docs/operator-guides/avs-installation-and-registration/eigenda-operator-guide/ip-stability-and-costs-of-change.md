# IP Stability & Costs of Change

It is important to ensure that your EigenDA Node service (addressed by IP:Port, which needs to register on-chain) is reachable from the internet. The chart below summarizes the potential IP sharing and stability options for Operators.

|                        | Shared IP                                                                                                                           | Dedicated IP                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stable IP              | ❌ Note: this will still work, if operators themselves figure out how to make the IP:Port reachable, e.g. configure port forwarding. | ✅ This is the ideal case for an EigenDA operator.                                                                                                                |
| Unstable (Changing) IP | ❌ Note: this will still work, if operators themselves figure out how to make the IP:Port reachable, e.g. configure port forwarding. | ✅ Although this will work, operators are encouraged to have a stable IP, because changing IP will incur an Eth transaction (to update IP on-chain) and cost gas. |
