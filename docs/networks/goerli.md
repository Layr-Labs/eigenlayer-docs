# Goerli (Deprecated)

The EigenDA Goerli testnet was the first EigenDA testnet, and was sunset on
_Friday, March 14, 2024_, following the Ethereum Dencun upgrade the day before,
and [an announcement from the EF regarding the Goerli sunset][ref1]. The EigenDA
Goerli testnet is succeeded by the [EigenDA Holesky testnet](./holesky.md).
