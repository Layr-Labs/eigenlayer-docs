## Testing Restaking on the Holesky Testnet

Users are encouraged to first test their staking approach on the Holesky Testnet prior to restaking on ETH Mainnet.

* Follow the instructions in [Obtaining Testnet ETH & Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)](obtaining-testnet-eth-and-liquid-staking-tokens-lsts.md) to fund your Testnet wallet.
* Visit [holesky.eigenlayer.xyz](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/) for the most recent EigenLayer Testnet web app.



## Testnet vs Mainnet Differences

- Withdraw (Escrow) Period:
    - All funds unstaked from _EigenLayer Testnet_ go through a delay (escrow period) of 25 blocks (roughly 5 minutes) before being able to be withdrawn.
    - Liquid tokens and Native Restaking funds unstaked from _EigenLayer Mainnet_ will go through a 14-day escrow period before being able to be withdrawn.
- Testnet includes the Slashing and Operator Sets upgrade. Please see [ELIP-002: Slashing via Unique Stake & Operator Sets](https://github.com/eigenfoundation/ELIPs/blob/main/ELIPs/ELIP-002.md) for more information.
