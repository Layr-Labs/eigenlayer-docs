# Restake and Delegate

The following instructions will walk you through how tokens can be restaked on the [EigenLayer Web App](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/).

**Step 1:** Open the EigenLayer App and connect your Web3 wallet. Visit EigenLayer on the Ethereum Mainnet at [app.eigenlayer.xyz](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/).

**Step 2:** Click **Token** tab to view assets available for restaking.

**Step 3:** Click on the asset you wish to restake. Choose the amount of the asset you wish to restake. Click **Submit** to continue.

:::info
This guide to Liquid Staking refers to all assets displayed on the Token tab, except for `Natively Staked Ether`, which refers to [Native Staking here](../native-restaking/README.md).

If you have not yet delegated your assets to an Operator, you will be prompted to do so at this step. Click on an Operator then click **Submit** to continue.

**Step 4:** Token Approval, Deposit, and Delegate transactions:
- If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to **Approve** token spending before you can restake. [Token Approval](https://support.metamask.io/transactions-and-gas/transactions/what-is-a-token-approval) gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet.
- If you have not yet delegated assets to an Operator, you will receive two transaction prompts: one for the **Deposit** transaction and second for the **Delegate** transaction.

**Step 5:** **Sign** the transaction(s) via your Web3 wallet to continue.


**Step 6:** Observe the confirmation that the Restake operation is completed.
