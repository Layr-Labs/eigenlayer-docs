# Delegate EIGEN, LSTs, and Native Restaked ETH to an Operator

Follow the steps below to initiate delegation of your Restaked balance to an Operator of your choice. This Restaked balance includes EIGEN tokens, LST tokens, and Native Restaked TVL.

Delegation is a unified step in the standard EIGEN and LST Restaking flow. For Native Restakers or scenarios where the unified Restaking flow was not completed, the following steps will allow you to delegate your stake directly.



**Step 1:** Navigate to the **Operator** page to view a list of available Operators.

**Step 4:** Confirm the transaction in your Web3 wallet.

**Step 5:** Note the delegating progress message.

**Step 6:** After the transaction has been confirmed, please note your stake will show as Delegated for that Operator.
