title: Rewards Split
---

Operators earn rewards by opting into the Operator Sets of AVSs that implement Rewards. By default, Operators earn a 10% split
on Rewards. The rest of the reward is claimable by the Operatorâ€™s delegated Stakers. Rewards are proportional to:

* The amount of stake.
* The AVS's relative weighting of strategies in a rewards submission.
* The number of days during the eligible timeframe of the reward submission that the Staker was delegated to the Operator.

For information on how to change the default rewards split, refer to [Set Rewards Split](../../../operators/howto/confirgurerewards/set-rewards-split.md).
