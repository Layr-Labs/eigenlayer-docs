title: Rewards Claiming
---

The process to claim rewards is the same for AVS Rewards and Programmatic Incentives. That is, both AVS Rewards and Programmatic
Incentives are displayed as claimable rewards in the EigenLayer app and by the EigenLayer CLI.

The posted distribution roots contain cumulative earnings. That is, Stakers and Operators do not have to claim against every
root and claiming against the most recent root will claim anything not yet claimed.

For information on configuring and claiming rewards, refer to:
