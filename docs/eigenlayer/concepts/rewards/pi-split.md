title: Programmatic Incentives Split
---

[Programmatic Incentives](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/programmatic-incentives/programmatic-incentives-faq) are EIGEN tokens minted by the EigenLayer protocol to Stakers and Operators.
Programmatic Incentives are claimed, and Operators can set a variable split of Programmatic Incentives, in the same way as Rewards.

To receive Programmatic Incentives:

* Operators must be opted into at least one Operator Set for at least one AVS.
* Stakers must be delegated to an Operator that is opted into at least one Operator Set for at least one AVS.

By default, Operators earn a 10% split on Programmatic Incentives. The rest of the Programmatic Incentives are claimable 
by the Operatorâ€™s delegated Stakers. Programmatic Incentive distributions are proportional to delegated stake.

For information on how to change the default Programmatic Incentives split, refer to [Set Programmatic Incentives Split](../../../operators/howto/confirgurerewards/set-pi-split).
