:::important
Stake delegated to an Operator can become slashable, and when redistributable slashing is live on mainnet, previously delegated
stake can become redistributable if an Operator allocates to a redistributable Operator Set. Stakers are responsible for 
ensuring that they fully understand and confirm their risk tolerances for existing and future delegations to Operators and the 
Operatorâ€™s slashable allocations. Additionally, Stakers are responsible for continuing to monitor the allocations of their 
chosen Operators as they update allocations across various Operator Sets.

AVSs using redistribution, and Operators running those AVSs, will be marked with appropriate metadata onchain and in the EigenLayer app.
:::

Safety delays are applied when allocating or deallocating to prevent rapid stake movements. Safety delays:
* Ensure stability. Delays ensure gradual transitions when stake is being allocated or dellocated enabling AVSs to adjust to changes in Operator security.
* Reduce risks from slashing. Delays ensure that staked assets remain at risk for a period after deallocation preventing the withdrawal of stake immediately before a slashing event to avoid slashing penalties.
* Preventing stake cycling to collect rewards. Delays ensure commitment periods to securing an AVS.

:::note
[ELIP-006 Redistibutable Slashing](https://github.com/eigenfoundation/ELIPs/blob/main/ELIPs/ELIP-006.md) introduced the Slash Escrow. Redistibutable Slashing is available in v1.5 on testnets and will be
available on mainnet in Q3.
:::

EigenLayer has a slashing delay, known as Slash Escrow, which is a critical security measure to bring guarantees to protocol outflows.
All slashed funds (burnt or redistributed) go through a 4-day escrow period. The intention of the protocol design is to permit
[Eigen Foundation governance](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/protocol-governance/technical-architecture) to interface with 
the slash escrow contracts in the case of a catastrophic slashing bug. An example of a catastrophic slashing bug is an implementation 
bug in the protocol where an AVS could slash beyond its allocated unique stake (for example, a total protocol TVL drain). 
For more information, refer to Slash Escrow in the Security section.
