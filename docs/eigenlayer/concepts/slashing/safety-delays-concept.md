:::important
When the Slashing and Operator Set upgrade is live on mainnet, stake can become slashable for a Staker that has previously 
delegated stake to an Operator. Stakers are responsible for ensuring that they fully understand and confirm their risk tolerances 
for existing and future delegations to Operators and the Operatorâ€™s slashable allocations. Additionally, stakers are responsible 
for continuing to monitor the allocations of their chosen Operators as they update allocations across various Operator Sets.
:::

Safety delays are applied when allocating or deallocating to prevent rapid stake movements. Safety delays:
* Ensure stability. Delays ensure gradual transitions when stake is being allocated or dellocated enabling AVSs to adjust to changes in Operator security.
* Reduce risks from slashing. Delays ensure that staked assets remain at risk for a period after deallocation preventing the withdrawal of stake immediately before a slashing event to avoid slashing penalties.
* Preventing stake cycling to collect rewards. Delays ensure commitment periods to securing an AVS.

For more information on provided safety delays, refer to the [Safety Delays reference](../../reference/safety-delays-reference).
