## Overview

The EigenLayer Sidecar is an open source, permissionless, verified indexer enabling anyone (AVS, operator, etc) to access EigenLayer's protocol in real-time.

Sidecar provides the following benefits to users:
- Access to EigenLayer protocol data through easy-to-use APIs.
- Running your own Sidecar allows you to validate rewards roots posted on chain by being able to re-create them.
- Direct database access gives power-users the ability to explore protocol data directly and natively.

## How to Use Sidecar

Please see the [README.md documentation here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/sidecar?tab=readme-ov-file#eigenlayer-sidecar).
