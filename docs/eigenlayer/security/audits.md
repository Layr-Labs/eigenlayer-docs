# Audits

As a key component of our development process, please see the most recent audits that help assess the robustness and reliability of our systems:
- [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/dev/audits/Sigma%20Prime%20-%20Core%20Audit%20-%20v2.0%20FINAL%20-%20Feb'24.pdf)  
- [Dedaub](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/blob/m2-mainnet/audits/Dedaub%20-%20Middleware%20Audit%20-%20Final%20-%20Feb'24.pdf) 

Please see the following repositories for past audits:
- [EigenLayer-Contracts / Audits](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/tree/dev/audits)
- [EigenLayer-Middleware / Audits](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/tree/m2-mainnet/audits)

We encourage you to review all audits carefully as they offer an in-depth analysis of our technology's capabilities, security measures, and overall reliability.

Instructions are also available for [Installation and Running Tests / Analyzers](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts#installation) via the Github repo.
