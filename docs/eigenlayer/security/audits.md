# Audits

As part of our development process, we are excited to present audits to assess the robustness and reliability of our systems.

Audit 1: [Consensys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2023/03/eigenlabs-eigenlayer/)
Delve into this thorough examination as it evaluates the various components of our technology. Uncover insights about the architecture and security measures ensuring that you have a comprehensive understanding of our system's integrity.

Audit 2: [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/master/audits/Sigma_Prime_Eigen_Layer_Phase_2_Security_Assessment_Report_v2_1.pdf)  
Explore this comprehensive assessment that focuses on evaluating compliance, functionality, and security adherence to industry standards. Gain valuable insights into our implementation strategies, code architecture, and general engineering practices.

We encourage you to review both audits carefully, as they offer an in-depth analysis of our technology's capabilities, security measures, and overall reliability.

Instructions are also available for [Installation and Running Tests / Analyzers](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts#installation) via the Github repo.
