# Audits

As part of our development process, we are excited to present audits to assess the robustness and reliability of our systems.

- [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/dev/audits/Sigma%20Prime%20-%20Core%20Audit%20-%20v2.0%20FINAL%20-%20Feb'24.pdf)

We encourage you to review all audits carefully as they offer an in-depth analysis of our technology's capabilities, security measures, and overall reliability.

Instructions are also available for [Installation and Running Tests / Analyzers](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts#installation) via the Github repo.
