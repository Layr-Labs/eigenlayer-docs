# Restake EIGEN and LSTs

Restake your EIGEN and LST tokens by following the steps below.

**Step 1:** Open the EigenLayer App and connect your Web3 wallet. Visit EigenLayer on the Ethereum Mainnet at app.eigenlayer.xyz.

**Step 2:** Select the token you want to restake.

**Step 3:** Token Approval. Enter the amount you would like to restake and click **Deposit**.

If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to **Approve** token spending before you can restake. [Token Approval](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683-What-is-a-token-approval-) gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet. Set a spending cap, and click **Next**.

**Step 4:** Once the token Approval transaction is confirmed, you will be prompted to confirm the **Deposit** transaction. 

**Step 5:** Confirm the **Deposit** transaction via your wallet. Observe the corresponding increase in your Restaked balance in the app:

## Delegate Your EIGEN and LST Tokens

After your tokens have been fully restaked in EigenLayer, delegate your tokens to an Operator to contribute to the shared security of the EigenLayer ecosystem.

Click the **Delegate** button on the EIGEN and LST token pages to begin delegating to an operator.

Please see the [Delegate to An Operator](/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/0-restaking-user-guide/restaker-delegation/delegate-to-an-operator.md) for more detail.
