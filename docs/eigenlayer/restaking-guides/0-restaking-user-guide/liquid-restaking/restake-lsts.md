# Restake LSTs & Stake EIGEN

Restake your LSTs & Stake EIGEN by following the steps below.

**Step 1:** Open the EigenLayer App and connect your Web3 wallet. Visit EigenLayer on the Ethereum Mainnet at app.eigenlayer.xyz.

**Step 2:** Select the token you want to restake.

**Step 3:** Token Approval. Enter the amount you would like to restake and click **Deposit**.

If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to **Approve** token spending before you can restake. [Token Approval](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683-What-is-a-token-approval-) gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet. Set a spending cap, and click **Next**.

**Step 4:** Once the token Approval transaction is confirmed, you will be prompted to confirm the **Deposit** transaction. 

**Step 5:** Confirm the **Deposit** transaction via your wallet. Observe the corresponding increase in your Restaked balance in the app:

## Delegate Your LSTs & EIGEN

After your tokens have been fully restaked in EigenLayer, delegate your tokens to an Operator to contribute to the shared security of the EigenLayer ecosystem.

Click the **Delegate** button on the EIGEN and LST token pages to begin delegating to an operator.

Please see the [Delegate to An Operator](/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/0-restaking-user-guide/restaker-delegation/delegate-to-an-operator.md) page for more detail.
