**Step 4:** Token Approval, Deposit, and Delegate transactions:
- If this is your first time depositing a token on EigenLayer, you'll need to **Approve** token spending before you can restake. [Token Approval](https://support.metamask.io/transactions-and-gas/transactions/what-is-a-token-approval) gives a dApp permission to move the specified token from your wallet.
- If you have not yet delegated assets to an Operator, you will receive two transaction prompts: one for the **Deposit** transaction and second for the **Delegate** transaction.

**Step 5:** **Sign** the transaction(s) via your Web3 wallet to continue.


**Step 6:** Observe the confirmation that the Restake operation is completed.
