Please see the [EigenFoundation documentation site](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/) for full details on the EIGEN token. This page will only cover behaviors of EIGEN token related to Restaking on the EigenLayer protocol.

### Can I Restake and Delegate EIGEN without Restaking and Delegating another type of asset (LST or Native Restaked ETH)?

Yes.

### Can I undelegate (and unstake) EIGEN without also undelegating (and unstaking) other assets?

No. Per the [Undelegate from an Operator and Initiate Withdrawal](../0-restaking-user-guide/restaker-delegation/undelegate-from-an-operator-and-initiate-withdrawal.md), the action of Undelegation queues withdrawal (unstaking) for all restaked assets simultaneously.

### What is the contract address for EIGEN?

Please see the Deployments table [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/?tab=readme-ov-file#strategies---eigen).
