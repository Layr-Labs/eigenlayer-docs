#### When can I claim my rewards?

After a root is posted, rewards are claimable after an activation delay. On mainnet this delay is 1 week and on testnet it is 2 hours.

#### What portion of rewards goes to my operator?

Operators get a fixed 10% portion rewards. In a future release this will be variable. 

#### How can I receive rewards on testnet?

To accumulate Rewards on Testnet for testing purposes you must be or delegate to an operator who has opted into an AVS with active rewards. EigenDA is one such AVS.
