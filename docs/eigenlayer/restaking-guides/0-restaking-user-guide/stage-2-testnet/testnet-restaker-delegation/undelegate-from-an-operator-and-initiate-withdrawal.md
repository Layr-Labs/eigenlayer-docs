# Undelegate from an Operator and Initiate Withdrawal

Restakers can Undelegate their balance from an Operator at any time. Undelegation flows are the same for both Native and LST Restakers.

If you would like to **Undelegate from an Operator and then Redelegate** your restaked funds, remember to click the "Redeposit" button for the Unstaked balance in order to Restake the funds (Step 4 below). This Redeposit action is possible even if restaking for the given asset (including LST) has been paused or capped.

:::warning
Initiating an Undelegate transaction will also automatically queue a withdrawal (Unstake) of your funds. The Undelegate and Queue Withdrawal transactions are combined due to the security architecture of EigenLayer smart contracts.

## Instructions to Undelegate and Queue Withdraw

**Step 1:** Navigate to the Operator tab, click the tile for the Operator you have delegated your funds to. Click the Undelegate button to continue.
