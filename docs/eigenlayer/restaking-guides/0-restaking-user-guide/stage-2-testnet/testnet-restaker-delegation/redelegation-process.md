# Redelegation Process

Redelegation is available for multiple scenarios for both LST and Native Restakers:
- Restaker would like to undelegate from their current operator, restake, and then delegate to a new operator.
- A user who accidentally queues a withdrawal, but would like to resume restaking and delegation without having to exit and re-enter their validators from the beacon chain.

Please see the following section [Undelegate from an Operator and Initiate Withdrawal](./undelegate-from-an-operator-and-initiate-withdrawal.md)
