This track will be focused on building example AVSs, reference architectures that other developers can use to build out their own custom AVSs, or any tooling that makes building AVSs easier.

Anything that accomplished the above objective is eligible, but if you're looking for ideas here are a few:

**Reference architectures in Go, Rust, or TypeScript/JavaScript**

3. Services

#### Track 1 juding criteria
1. Documentation - the better the documentation the higher the score.
