To be eligible, you must open source your code and share your project on X and / or Farcaster or Lens.

#### Ideas

This track will be focused on building example AVSs, reference architectures that other developers can use to build out their own custom AVSs, or any tooling that makes building AVSs easier.

Anything that accomplished the above objective is eligible, but if you're looking for ideas here are a few:

**Reference architectures in Go, Rust, or TypeScript/JavaScript**
1. More advanced "Hello worlds"
2. Oracles
3. Off-chain data verification (i.e. sports scores or election data)
4. Coprocessors
5. AI execution
6. Databases
7. IPFS pinning
8. Permanent file storage
9. Data archival
10. FHE
11. Execution environments

**Developer tooling**
1. SDKs
2. CLIs and scaffolding tools
3. Services

#### Track 1 juding criteria
1. Documentation - the better the documentation the higher the score.
2. Code quality - well organized and readable code will score higher.
3. Extensibility - how easy can a developer use this to build out their own idea?
4. DX - does the project provide a high quality developer experience?

### 2. AVS Education Hackathon - Tutorials, videos, & guides on EigenLayer AVSs

- First prize 7,500 USDC plus 1 ticket and trip to ETHCC, dinner with team
- Second prize 5,000 USDC
- Third prize 2,500 USDC
- Fourth prize 2,500 USDC
- Fifth prize 2,500 USDC

This track is focused on educating developers on all things AVSs - technical deep dives, how to build them, and how to use them. Including education about AVSs already live on mainnet.

Submissions can be in the form of a video, blog post, social media post, or really any publicly viewable digital content.
