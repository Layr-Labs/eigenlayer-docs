[**EigenLayer: The Restaking Collective**](/EigenLayer_WhitePaper.pdf): the research paper that formed the basis of the EigenLayer protocol development. The document discusses the original architecture of EigenLayer, the Restaking primitive, and the concept of AVSs.


**[EIGEN: The Universal Intersubjective Work Token](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/whitepaper/blob/master/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf)**: the research paper that introduces the structure of the EIGEN token, a universal intersubjective work token. We view this intersubjective work token as a first step towards the goal of building the Verifiable Digital Commons.
