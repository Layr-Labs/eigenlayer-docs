These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. Please read these Terms carefully, as they include important information about your legal rights. By accessing and/or using the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.

For purposes of these Terms, "**you**" and "**your**" means you as the user of the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company or other entity then "you" includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity's behalf.

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS EXPLAINED IN SECTION 9.

1. **THE SERVICES**
    1. Services. The Services provide a front-end interface (the "**App**") that display data that facilitates users interfacing with a set of decentralized open-sourced smart contracts that allow for the restaking of digital assets, such as Ether (ETH). These underlying smart contracts are referred to herein as the "**EigenLayer Protocol**”.  The Services may also reference or provide an App or APIs related to smart contracts that provide a data availability service built on top of Ethereum. These underlying smart contracts are referred to herein as the “**EigenDA Protocol**”. Collectively, the EigenLayer Protocol and EigenDA Protocol are referred to herein as the **“Protocols**”). The Services also provide documentation available at [docs.eigenlayer.xyz](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz) related to the App and Protocol ("**Documentation**"). **The Protocols are not part of the Services, and your use of the Protocols is entirely at your own risk. Additionally, the third party technologies required to be used or interacted with in order to interact with the Protocols, including but not limited to a Wallet (as defined below, and collectively the “Third-Party Tools”), are not part of the Services, and your use of such Third-Party Tools are entirely at your own risk.** The App is separate and distinct from either of the Protocols and any Third-Party Tools. The App is not essential to accessing the Protocols. The App merely displays blockchain data and provides a web application that reduces the complexity of using the Third-Party Tools or otherwise accessing either of the Protocols. All activity on each of the Protocols is run by permissionless smart contracts, and other developers are free to create their own interfaces to function with the Protocols.

    2. Wallets. To use certain of the Services you may need to link a third-party digital wallet (**"Wallet"**) with the Services. By using a Wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are using the Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable third-party provider of such Wallet. Wallets are not associated with, maintained by, supported by or affiliated with the Company. You acknowledge and agree that we are not party to any transactions conducted while accessing our App, and we do not have possession, custody or control over any digital assets appearing on the Services. When you interact with the App, you retain control over your digital assets at all times. The Company accepts no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of a Wallet, and makes no representations and warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any specific Wallet. **The private keys and/or seed phrases necessary to access the assets held in a Wallet are not held by the Company. The Company has no ability to help you access or recover your private keys and/or seed phrases for your Wallet, so please keep them in a safe place.**

    3. Updates; Monitoring. We may make any improvement, modifications or updates to the Services, including but not limited to changes and updates to the underlying software, infrastructure, security protocols, technical configurations or service features (the "**Updates**") from time to time. Your continued access and use of the Services are subject to such Updates and you shall accept any patches, system upgrades, bug fixes, feature modifications, or other maintenance work that arise out of such Updates. We are not liable for any failure by you to accept and use such Updates in the manner specified or required by us. Although the Company is not obligated to monitor access to or participation in the Services, it has the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Services, to ensure compliance with the Terms and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements.

    4. The Company may charge or pass through fees for some or part of the Services we make available to you, including transaction or processing fees, blockchain gas or similar network fees. We will disclose the amount of fees we will charge or pass through to you for the applicable Service at the time you access, use or otherwise transact with the Services. Although we will attempt to provide accurate fee information, any such information reflects our estimate of fees, which may vary from the fees actually paid to use the Services and interact with the applicable blockchain with which the Services are compatible. Additionally, your external Wallet provider may impose a fee to transact on the Services. We are not responsible for any fees charged by a third party. All transactions processed through the Services are non-refundable. You will be responsible for paying any and all taxes, duties and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your use of the Services. In certain cases, your transactions through the Services may not be successful due to an error with the blockchain or the Wallet. We accept no responsibility or liability to you for any such failed transactions, or any transaction or gas fees that may be incurred by you in connection with such failed transactions. You acknowledge and agree that all information you provide with respect to transactions on the Services, including, without limitation, credit card, bank account, PayPal or other payment information is accurate, current and complete, and you have the legal right to use such payment method.

    5. Rewards.  In your use of the Services, you may be attributed certain reputation indicators, points, or other intangible rewards (“**Rewards”**).

SOME JURISDICTIONS (SUCH AS THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY) DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    3. Assumption of Risks.
        1. By using the Services, you represent that you have sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters, including a sufficient understanding of blockchain or cryptographic tokens and technologies and other digital assets, storage mechanisms (such as Wallets), blockchain-based software systems, and blockchain technology, to be able to assess and evaluate the risks and benefits of the Services contemplated hereunder, and will bear the risks thereof, including loss of all amounts paid, and the risk that the tokens may have little or no value. You acknowledge and agree that there are risks associated with purchasing and holding cryptocurrency, using blockchain technology and staking cryptocurrency. These include, but are not limited to, risk of losing access to cryptocurrency due to slashing, loss of private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, risk of mining or blockchain attacks, risk of hacking and security weaknesses, risk of unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions, risk related to token taxation, risk of personal information disclosure, risk of uninsured losses, volatility risks, and unanticipated risks. You acknowledge that cryptocurrencies are not (i) deposits of or guaranteed by a bank (ii) insured by the FDIC or by any other governmental agency and (iii) that we do not custody and cannot transfer any cryptocurrency or digital assets you may interact with on the Services or Protocols. 
        1. There are certain multi-signature crypto wallets (the "**MultiSigs**", and the signatories to such MultiSigs, the "**MultiSig Committee Members**") that have certain controls related to one or more of the Protocols, that may include, but are not limited to, the ability to pause certain functionality of the Protocols, reverse or pause slashing, implement or influence upgrades to the Protocols (or any aspect thereof) and certain other controls of the functionality of the Protocols as described in the documentation or in public communications made by us. Certain MultiSigs may be controlled by us or MultiSig Committee Members that are employed or engaged by us, and certain other MultiSigs will be controlled partially or entirely by MultiSig Committee Members that are unaffiliated third parties over which we have no or limited control. We will not be able to control the actions of such MultiSig Committee Members if they are not employed or engaged by us and thus certain MultiSigs will be outside of our control.
        1. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and other digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the potential utility or value of such cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

        1. Smart contracts execute automatically when certain conditions are met.

If you are obligated to indemnify any Company Entity or MultiSig Committee Members hereunder, then you agree that the Company (or, at its discretion, the applicable Company Entity) or MultiSig Committee Members, as applicable, will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether the Company or MultiSig Committee Member, as applicable, wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with the Company or MultiSig Committee Members in the defense or settlement of such claim.

9. **ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

    1. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY -- IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
    2. Informal Process First. You and the Company agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the Company Entities or the MultiSig Committee Members, either party will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action, after first allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond. Both you and the Company agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against you, any Company Entity or any MultiSig Committee Members, as applicable.
    3. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, "**Claim**") relating in any way to the Services, including the App, any use or access or lack of access thereto, and any other usage of the Protocols even if interacted with outside of the Services or App, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and the Company agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "**JAMS Rules**") then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). Because your contract with the Company, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis -- class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Company are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.
    4. Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and the Company agree that the following types of disputes will be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction: (i) disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual dispute and not as a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding; (ii) disputes or claims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public injunctive relief); or (iii) intellectual property disputes.
    5. Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, the Company will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as set forth below).

        1. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the applicable rules. If you prevail in the arbitration and are awarded an amount that is less than the last written settlement amount offered by the Company before the arbitrator was appointed, the Company will pay you the amount it offered in settlement. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

    1. **Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to notices@eigenlabs.org. The notice must be sent to the Company within thirty (30) days of your first registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action waiver still applies. You may not opt out of only the class action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them.**
    2. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY WILL BE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING ("CLASS ACTION"). YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION. YOU AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM. IF THE DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. FURTHER, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, HOWEVER, YOU CAN SEEK PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND CONSISTENT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE ABOVE.
        3. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES' AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH ARE DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.
