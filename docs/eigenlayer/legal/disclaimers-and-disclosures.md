### EMPLOYEE AND INVESTOR LOCKUP ON EIGEN

EIGEN received from Eigen Labs by its employees or investors is subject to the following lockup schedule: 4% of each recipient’s respective EIGEN will unlock on September 30, 2025, and an additional 4% will unlock each month thereafter, such that all EIGEN will be unlocked by September 30, 2027 (the “**Lockup Schedule**”).

### EMPLOYEE AND INVESTOR STAKING ON EIGENLAYER

It was [previously communicated](https://blog.eigenfoundation.org/announcement/) that Investors and Early Contributors would be on the above Lockup Schedule. We want to clarify Eigen Labs company policies with respect to staking EIGEN and other assets and any EIGEN rewards:

#### Employees:
- **EIGEN staking**: Eigen Labs restricts its current and former employees from staking any EIGEN received from Eigen Labs on EigenLayer until at least September 30th, 2025.
- **Other assets staking**: Eigen Labs does not restrict its employees from staking other assets on EigenLayer (including ETH and LSTs), and any rewards received (including EIGEN) from such staking will not be subject to the Lockup Schedule.
- **Stakedrops**: Eigen Labs employees were not permitted to claim stakedrops.

#### Investors:
- **EIGEN staking**: Eigen Labs [Investors](https://www.eigenlabs.org/#investors) are not restricted from staking EIGEN on EigenLayer. As such, investors may choose to stake their EIGEN and receive staking rewards the same as any other user. While EIGEN received by investors from Eigen Labs is subject to the Lockup Schedule, any EIGEN received by investors as rewards from staking will not be subject to the Lockup Schedule.
  - *Note*: As previously communicated, Investors did not receive rewards or airdrop allocation for any staking of EIGEN prior to September 30, 2024.
- **Other assets staking**: Eigen Labs does not restrict [Investors](https://www.eigenlabs.org/#investors) from staking other assets on EigenLayer (including ETH and LSTs), and any rewards received (including EIGEN) from such staking will not be subject to the Lockup Schedule.
- **Stakedrops**: Investors were not restricted from claiming stakedrops.

**25% programmatic incentives go to EIGEN staking, while the remaining 75% go to ETH and ETH-equivalent staking assets.*
