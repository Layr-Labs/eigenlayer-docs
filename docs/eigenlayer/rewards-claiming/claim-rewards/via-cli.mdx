# Using CLI

Follow the instructions below step by step in order to claim your currently available rewards in the EigenLayer web app via EigenLayer CLI. Rewards can be claimed by a Staker or Operator.

## Quick Steps

### Step 1: Install the latest version of EigenLayer CLI

Head over to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli#install-eigenlayer-cli-using-a-binary) for getting the binary with your preferred way. 

Below steps assume that you have used the default binary installation command and your binary is installed at `./bin/` location


### Step 2: Check if installation is correct
```bash
./bin/eigenlayer --version
```
This should output the version of EigenLayer CLI installed
```bash
eigenlayer version v<X.X.X>
```

### Step 3: Check if rewards are available to claim
<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    ```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards show \
      --network mainnet \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --claim-type unclaimed

    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="holesky" label="Holesky">
    ```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards show \
      --network holesky \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --claim-type unclaimed
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will output the token address and the amount of unclaimed rewards available 
```bash
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Token Address                              | Wei Amount
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x554c393923c753d146aa34608523ad7946b61662 | 6324648267039518
0xdf3b00151bf851e8c4036ceda284d38a2f1d09df | 132817613607829878
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Step 4: Ensure you have your keys in place
Claiming rewards requires you to have access to your wallet keys. 
Supported Key Management options are listed [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli/blob/master/README.md#supported-key-management-backends)

:::info
If you already have your keys in either of the supported key management options, you can skip this step.
:::

In case you have your keys in some browser wallet, you can import your keys to local keystore file by using the following command
```bash
./bin/eigenlayer keys import \
  --key-type <key-type> <private-key-hex>
```
This will ask you to set a password to protect your keystore file.

Refer your browser wallet documentation to get the `private-key-hex`.

### Step 5: Claim the rewards

Make sure the keys you are using to claim is the claimer you have set.
<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    If you are using local keystore file, use the following command to claim rewards
    
    ```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards claim \
      --network mainnet \
      --eth-rpc-url <mainnet-eth-rpc-url> \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --recipient-address <address-to-send-rewards-to> \
      --path-to-key-store /path/to/key/store-json \
      --token-addresses <comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses> \
      --broadcast
    ```
    `comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses` - You can get this from output of [Step 3](#step-3-check-if-rewards-are-available-to-claim)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="holesky" label="Holesky">
    If you are using local keystore file, use the following command to claim rewards
    
    ```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards claim \
      --network holesky \
      --eth-rpc-url <holesky-eth-rpc-url> \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --recipient-address <address-to-send-rewards-to> \
      --path-to-key-store /path/to/key/store-json \
      --token-addresses <comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses> \
      --broadcast
    ```
    `comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses` - You can get this from output of Step 3
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you are using private key hex, fireblocks or web3 signer check the command help for the respective key management backend.
```bash
./bin/eigenlayer rewards claim --help
```

### Step 6: (Optional) Check the rewards paramters
If you want to see the rewards parameters before claiming, you can use the following command
<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    If you are using local keystore file, use the following command to claim rewards
    
    ```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards claim \
      --network holesky \
      --eth-rpc-url <mainnet-eth-rpc-url> \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --token-addresses <comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses>
    ```
    `comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses` - You can get this from output of [Step 3](#step-3-check-if-rewards-are-available-to-claim)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="holesky" label="Holesky">
    If you are using local keystore file, use the following command to claim rewards
    
    ```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards claim \
      --network holesky \
      --eth-rpc-url <holesky-eth-rpc-url> \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --token-addresses <comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses>
    ```
    `comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses` - You can get this from output of Step 3
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Advanced configurations
### Setting an address to claim rewards on earners behalf
If you want a different address to claim the rewards on earners behalf, you can set the claimer using the following command
```bash
./bin/eigenlayer rewards set-claimer \
  --network mainnet \
  --eth-rpc-url <mainnet-eth-rpc-url> \
  --earner-address <earner-address> \
  --claimer-address <claimer-address> \
  --path-to-key-store /path/to/key/store-json \
  --broadcast
```

### Claiming rewards when earner is a smart contract
If the earner is a smart contract, you can claim rewards by either generating a JSON object with the arguments to the call `processClaim`
method on rewards coordinator contract
or generate a calldata which can be signed and broadcasted.

To generate the JSON object, use the following command
```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards claim \
      --network mainnet \
      --eth-rpc-url <mainnet-eth-rpc-url> \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --recipient-address <address-to-send-rewards-to> \
      --path-to-key-store /path/to/key/store-json \
      --token-addresses <comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses> \
      --output-type json
```

To generate the calldata, use the following command
```bash
    ./bin/eigenlayer rewards claim \
      --network mainnet \
      --eth-rpc-url <mainnet-eth-rpc-url> \
      --earner-address <earner-address> \
      --recipient-address <address-to-send-rewards-to> \
      --path-to-key-store /path/to/key/store-json \
      --token-addresses <comma-separated-list-of-token-addresses> \
      --output-type calldata
```
