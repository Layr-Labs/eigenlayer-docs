Rewards can be claimed by a Staker or Operator as a claimer or earner. 

Key Definitions:
- Earner Address: an address that is actively earning rewards within the system.
- Claimer Address: an address that has been granted permission to claim rewards on behalf of one or more earning addresses.

## Claimer Instructions for Rewards

### Understanding Profiles

In the web app, a "profile" refers to an individual earning address that a Claimer address has been authorized to claim rewards for. A single Claimer address may have permissions for multiple Earner profiles.

When logged in as a Claimer address, you will see a list of all associated Earner profiles. Each profile represents an Earner address for which you have claim privileges.

### Claimer Address Login Instructions

1.	Navigate to the web app and log in with your Claimer address.
2.	Upon login, you will be presented with a list of Earner profiles associated with your Claimer address.
3.	Select a specific Earner profile to view its associated rewards.
4.	The only action enabled for a Claimer address is to claim rewards on behalf of the selected Earner profile.

**Visual Indicators for Claimer Addresses**

To differentiate between Claimer and Earner profiles, the app provides the following cues:
- When acting as a Claimer address, you will only see the Claim Rewards option.
- Switching between Earner profiles is seamless within the same session, allowing you to manage multiple profiles efficiently.

**Performance Note**

When logging in with a Claimer address that is associated with more than 100 Earner profiles, the app may experience a delay of up to 10 seconds while loading. This is considered an edge case, as most Claimer addresses are typically associated with one or two Earner profiles. We are working to optimize this behavior and expect improvements in future updates. In the meantime, if you experience delays, please allow the system time to load all profiles.
