# Using WebApp

Follow the instructions below step by step in order to claim your currently available rewards in the EigenLayer web app. Rewards can be claimed by a Staker or Operator as a claimer or earner. An earner is any address that receives rewards distributions. A claimer is any address that has been given permission to claim rewards on behalf of another earner address.

EIGEN token rewards are included in the displayed reward rates.
When you login with a Claimer address, loading more than 100 associated Earner address profiles may cause delays up to 10 seconds.
