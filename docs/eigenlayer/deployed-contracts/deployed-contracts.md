## EigenLayer Core Restaking Contracts

The EigenLayer core contracts are located in this repo: [`Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts`][ref1]. They enable restaking of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and beacon chain ETH to secure new services, called AVSs (actively validated services).

### Deployment Addresses

An up-to-date reference of our current mainnet and testnet contract deployments can be found in the core repository README: [`eigenlayer-contracts/README.md#deployments`][ref2].

### Technical Documentation

Our most up-to-date contract-level documentation can be found in the core repository's docs folder: [`eigenlayer-contracts/docs`][ref3].
