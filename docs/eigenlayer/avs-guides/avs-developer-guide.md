# AVS Developer Guide

### What is an AVS?

EigenLayer is a protocol built on Ethereum that introduces **restaking**: the process of staking consensus layer ETH to extend security to additional infrastructure services to earn additional rewards.

These infrastructure services are referred to as **Actively Validated Services (AVSs)**. AVS developers build the infrastructure logic and software, [stakers](/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/) provide stake to secure the infrastructure, and [operators](/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-introduction) run the AVS software.

### What can be built?

An AVS can be any system that requires its own distributed validation semantics for verification, such as sidechains, data availability layers, new virtual machines, keeper networks, oracle networks, bridges, threshold cryptography schemes, and trusted execution environments. Please see page 2 of the EigenLayer Whitepaper [here](/eigenlayer/overview/whitepaper) for the original definition and context of an AVS.

Check out the existing AVS ecosystem page [here](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/ecosystem?category=AVS) for an idea of what people are already building.

### Getting started
