An AVS deploys its service manager to interact with EigenLayer core contracts that allow for Operator registration to Operator Sets, slashing, and rewards distribution. Once registered, an Operator agrees to run the AVS’s off-chain code.

The document discusses the original architecture of EigenLayer, the Restaking primitive, and the concept of AVSs. Please note that some components of the design have changed since the original conception of the protocol. Use this document for high level guidance. For specific implementation details, please see the respective protocol implementation source code repositories.

- [Bug Bounty](eigenlayer/security/bug-bounty): Check out the official bug bounty program for EigenLayer on Immunefi
- [Guardrails](eigenlayer/security/guardrails): There will be a 7-day withdrawal delay that will serve as a security measure during the early stages of the EigenLayer mainnet, to optimize for the safety of assets. This withdrawal lag, which is common in staking protocols, is required when AVSs go live, as there is a lag to verify that activity associated with any AVS was completed successfully.
- [Governance](eigenlayer/security/multisig-governance): Please see EigenFoundation Governance for latest information.
- [Withdrawal Delay](eigenlayer/security/withdrawal-delay): EigenLayer contracts feature a withdrawal delay for LST tokens, EIGEN token, and Native Restaking, a critical security measure for instances of vulnerability disclosure or when anomalous behavior is detected by monitoring systems. The delays serve as a preventive mechanism and also allows, in certain cases, to help mitigate protocol attacks. When contracts are paused and withdrawals disabled, the system enables arbitrary state or code changes to the contracts through upgrades. While technically feasible, such interventions are not a routine practice and should be approached with caution.
- [Overview](operators/concepts/operator-introduction): What is a Node Operator within EigenLayer?
- [Operator Keys](operators/concepts/operator-keys): For information on Operator keys, refer to Keys.

- [Node and Smart Contract Operators](operators/howto/managekeys/institutional-operators): - Secure keys, including secrets such as passphrases or mnemonics, using services like AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault. These services can be seamlessly integrated with automated mechanisms that safely retrieve secrets or keys (e.g., remote signers). If resources permit, consider running your own Hashicorp Vault instance, which grants full custody of keys and secrets while sacrificing the service provider's availability and security guarantees.
- [Solo stakers](operators/howto/managekeys/solo-stakers): Individuals managing a limited number of validator keys typically do not require intricate distributed infrastructure for running nodes or employing remote signers. For these individuals, extensive staking services may be excessive and unnecessary. This means they will often store the keys with the decryption keys locally with the validator client or Node (which they maintain), which increases the vulnerability of the secrets, but, while stakers must safeguard validator keys against attacks, most key losses typically result from mundane reasons, such as losing the hardware containing the key. Users necessitate a backup strategy, mindful that if an attacker accesses the backed-up keys, they can sign any message deemed valid against the validator's public key. Appropriate precautions should be implemented to guarantee that backed-up validator keys are as inaccessible as feasible, ideally being completely offline and physically secure. Some of these precautions can be listed:
