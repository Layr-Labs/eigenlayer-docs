### Investigating [Feb 15, 2024 - 15:00 PT]

- **Incident Context:** We became aware of an issue on the Goerli testnet related to the EigenDA Churner that is not available. This incident is confined to the testnet, with no impact on our mainnet operations.
- **Impact:** EigenLayer operators are unable to opt-in or opt-out of EigenDA on Goerli testnet. Operator nodes are unable to request opt-in or opt-out requests, and are failing with a 404 error response. Existing nodes are not impacted.
- **Actions:** Our team declared this as an operational incident internally, and initiated a thorough investigation to understand the cause and impact of the issue.
