### Investigating [Feb 01, 2024 - 11:50 PT]

- **Incident Context:** We became aware of an issue on the Goerli testnet related to withdrawal proof generation that supports native ETH restaking functionality. This incident was confined to the testnet, with no impact on our mainnet operations.
- **Impact:** Staking users are not able to initiate EigenPod partial and full withdrawal on Goerli testnet.
- **Safety of User Assets:** While we work on a fix, we assure all users that all funds on Goerli and mainnet have been safe and secure throughout the incident.
- **Actions:** Our team declared this as an operational incident internally, and initiated a thorough investigation to understand the cause and impact of the issue.
